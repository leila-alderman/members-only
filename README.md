# Members only!

This Rails app allows users to write posts that appear anonymous to non-members. The authentication used in this app is created without the use of any gems, instead focusing on thoroughly understanding the basic steps of authentication.


[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication#project-2-members-only) is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
